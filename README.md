This repository contains all the code required to take a ground state MPS and encode it into a quantum circuit consisting of one and two-qubit unitary gates (using ITensor.jl), then using this circuit to warm start and run VQE simulations (Qiskit). We wish to explore efficient avenues to VQE, as well as show-off the versatility of tensor networks. This is still a work in progress.
