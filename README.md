This repositry contains all the code required to take a ground state MPS and encode it into a quantum circuit consisting of one and two-qubit unitary gates. I will soon reference the source to the existing algorithm. For this section, we use the ITensor library in Julia. Then, we transport our MPS encoded circuit onto Qiskit, and run VQE simulations. We wish to explore efficient avenues to VQE, as well as show-off the versatility of tensor networks. This is still a work in progress.
