This repository contains all the code needed to take a ground state MPS and encode it into a tensor network quantum circuit (TNQC) consisting of one and two-qubit unitary gates (using ITensor.jl). We use this TNQC to warm start and run VQE simulations (Qiskit). We wish to explore efficient avenues to VQE, as well as show the versatility of tensor networks. Note, this serves as a proof of concept. When dealing with system sizes manageable by classical computers, tensor networks will outperform any VQE simulation (in terms of ground state computation). This MPS -> VQE pipeline could yield quantum advantage for larger, highly correlated systems where tensor networks fail to capture the entanglement, but still provide a decent approximation suitable to warm start VQE.

In the code examples we use a 1D XYZ Hamiltonian and a 2D Spin Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Head to https://www.itensor.org/ to see how the ITensor Library works and how we implemented it.
